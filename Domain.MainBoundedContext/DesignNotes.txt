ABOUT SPECIFICATION PATTERN
---------------------------
The Specification pattern (originally defined by Eric Evans and Martin Fowler) is a good way to encapsulate query criteria and to do composition operations. 
Definition of the pattern: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specification_pattern
M.F and E.E. paper: http://www.martinfowler.com/apsupp/spec.pdf
Although the original pattern worked just with in-memory-objects, we changed the implementation to be based on Lambda-Expressions against EF,
so the performance can be much better.
Composing several expressions with AND, OR, NOT, (composition operations) cannot be done with simple expressions without implementing some ‘plumbing’.
Second reason is that Specifications allows defining a query criterion and simply referencing it. If you would want to do the same you’d need to make a class returning an expression, therefore it would be similar but with no composition, denial, etc. 
Ok, you can do something like: 
Expression<Func<T,bool>> expression = t.property==true; 
Which is really what we can be returning, but our specification implementation allows composition and criteria encapsulation instead of spreading it directly on lambda expressions.
Finally, the use of the composite specification pattern is not mandatory in this Architecture, for instance, instead of using a AllMatching() for specifications you can always use the filter method providing a lambda expression directly.

ABOUT MODULES & BOUNDED-CONTEXTS (BC)
-------------------------------------
The relationship between a BC and a MODEL is usually 1:1. But we could share the same database between several
different BC with a different view of the database for each (a diferent MODEL). Or the DB could also be different for each BC.
Then, we can have several MODULES per BOUNDEX-CONTEXT. MODULES organize elements within one MODEL, providing
different namespaces and some demarcation and organization. 
MODULES are like chapters (modules) in a book (BC-MODEL).
[For more info, see references from Eric Evans, Udi Dahan, etc. regarding BC]
 
IMPORTANT!!: Each MODEL depends on your specific DOMAIN. In our case, our fictitious DOMAIN is very simple 
because it is a sample-app, not a real app. Therefore, for our DOMAIN, we chose that we initially have
a single MainBoundedContext and two Modules (BankingModule and ERPModule) which share the same MODEL.
But of course, different DOMAINS have different MODELS and MODULES. In a large business app, probably
the ERP system would be a BOUNDED-CONTEXT and the Banking system would be another BOUNDED-CONTEXT, as both
concepts are really different in reality.
But in our fictitious DOMAIN, this is how we chose it to be, for simplicity. Our goal is only to show DDD patterns implementation using .NET,
not to teach how to apply DDD (Ubiquitous Language, DDD practices, etc.). There are excelent theorical books for that, like Eric Evans and many others.
Your BC, MODEL & MODULES will depend on your specific DOMAINS and you'll have to determine that 
while talking with your DOMAIN experts and business users.
 
Also, we called our BC as 'MainBoundedContext' because it is an example and we want explicitely to show what
is our Bounded-Context related to the MODEL. Usually, in a real project, you will simply name it with a meaningful name for your system, 
from your ubiquitous language.

BOUNDED-CONTEXTS COMPOSITION
There are a few patterns in order to compose several BC. We are not covering this subject within this .NET example, as we have a single BC and MODEL. 
In order to know more about this, search information about the following patterns:
- Shared Kernel
- Customer Supplier
- Conformist
- Anticorruption Layer
- Separate Ways
- Open-Host Service 

ABOUT ENTITIES AND AGGREGATES
-----------------------------
We would have liked to create a Domain Model 'even more precise', but in this first version of Code-First we still don't have some features we would like:
- Mapping private members (With no workaround playing with expression trees)
- Hiding our navigations in a better way.
 
In any case, we gave to our Domain Model a good 'object oriented sense', like it should be following DDD patterns (No Anemic-domain-model, etc.).
 
ABOUT AGGREGATE FACTORIES
-------------------------
This pattern is explained by Eric Evans in his book, and also is quite common in many DDD architectures.
Jimmy Nilson also makes a heavy use of this pattern in his DDD book.
Most DDD experts agree about that it is not mandatory to have a Factory for each Aggregate, 
but we only should used create and use Aggregate-Factories for those aggregates where its construction is complex.

SOBRE LAS ENTIDADES Y AGREGADOS
-------------------------------
Aquí, nos hubiera gustado realmente hacer un modelo de dominio "mas preciso", pero, en esta primera version de EF 4.1 y Code First no tenemos 
algunas features que hubiésemos querido. Desde el mapeo de miembros privados ( sin hacer el workaround de jugar con árboles de expresion ya que 
tiene otras consecuencias) hasta la posiblidad de esconder nuestras navegaciones de una forma más adecuada. No obstante, se ha intentado dotar 
al dominio de ese "sentido de la orientación a objetos" que realmente debe de tener.

SOBRE LAS FACTORIAS DE AGREGADOS
---------------------------------
En un patrón mostrado por Eric Evans en su ya más que mencionado libro, y también aparece en literatura técnica 
como por ejemplo el libro de Jimmy Nilson acerca de DDD. Hay algunas notas importantes 
acerca de como conseguir buenas factorias, generalmente estas notas hablan acerca de la opcionalidad de las mismas, 
no teniendo porque construirlas si en realida el objeto no es "dificil" de construir, 
así como la ausencia de factorias para las entidades pertenecientes a un aggregate root.
